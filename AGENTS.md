This repository is based on the elideus-metal template, it uses the following tech:
- Node 18 (required for atproto)
- TypeScript
- ESLint
- Vite
- Docker
- Python 3.12
- FastAPI
- atproto in React front end
- atproto in Python back end
- React TS
We have some default components already configured in the React front end including a user session context class and a theme class wrapping the main SPA page.

We will update this documet as more components are built so future analysis will remain relavant.
